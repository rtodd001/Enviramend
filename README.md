## Inspiration
To reverse the damage done to Earth while still being healthy.

## What it does
Scans barcodes and brand titles to cross reference ingredients with potentially harmful consequences to the environment. Additionally, Enviramend can store your allergies and warn you in case the allergen is in the item.

## How we built it
We used Android studio to build the app and integrated GitHub for collaboration. We were able to use the USDA nutrition database API to record the ingredients of item. We then created a list of harmful ingredients that negatively affect the ecosystem and compared it to the API.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was coming up with the idea for the hackathon. It was challenging setting all the APIs up and integrating them together. Taking a picture of the barcode was challenging because Android was not discarding the image right after capture.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to use Google-Cloud-Vision API for OCR and Barcode scanning. We are extremely proud of having a working model to showcase.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of teamwork, creativity, dedication, and having fun. It is not about the products make, but the friends we make along the way. Also we learned how difficult it is to use images for front end development for different android displays.

## What's next for Enviramend
**CHANGING THE WORLD**
